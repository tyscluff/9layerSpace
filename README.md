App I am building

I am making this project to help me learn node.js, express.js, React, and React Native
When I started I knew front end JavaScript and a little bit of React. As of December
this is what I've built in three months of teaching myself on YouTube. It has been changed
so that it based around the conecept of creating communities where people can ask you 
questions and then you can respond to questions and join communities to see what people
are asking the community owner
